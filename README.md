# OMR
The Automated Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) System is designed to read and process data from paper-based forms and answer sheets that contain pre-defined markings, such as bubbles or checkboxes. The system leverages image processing and machine learning techniques to accurately detect and interpret these marks, converting them into digital data.
