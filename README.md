# OMR
The Automated Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) System is designed to read and process data from paper-based forms and answer sheets that contain pre-defined markings, such as bubbles or checkboxes. The system leverages image processing and machine learning techniques to accurately detect and interpret these marks, converting them into digital data.


# key points
Ensure you have a proper answer key defined (ANSWER_KEY dictionary) that matches the format of your OMR sheets.
The program processes images of OMR sheets and displays the results, including the percentage score and the number of correct and wrong answers.
Make sure the images you test with are clear and well-scanned to ensure accurate processing.
